							<h3>History of Sports as Entertainment</h3>
                            <p>
                                <span class="image right"><img src="images/first_sports.png" alt="" /></span>
                                Sports have been an inescapable part of human history. They have provided a way for people to come together and compete in a friendly and controlled environment, and have often been used as a means of promoting physical fitness and health. In fact, the caves of Lascaux, France are decorated with depictions of wrestling dating back to 15,300 years ago. Throughout the ages, humans have recorded the influence and importance of sports in their culture, and consistently admired the great performers of each sport. In recent years, the impact of sports on society has only continued to grow. With the rise of professional sports leagues and the growth of television and other media, sports have become a major part of popular culture. As prominent gifted athletes emerge above the masses, a natural divide emerges between professional athletes and the fans of a sport who now turn to viewing sports. In the modern world, organized sports leagues are, before all, entertainment.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Rise of Esports</h3>
                            <p>In the early 2000s, as video games became more popular and accessible, a new kind of sport emerged. Esports, or electronic sports, is a form of competition in video games. Over the last two decades, esports have exploded in popularity, viewership, and participation. The largest prize pool for any given esports was just north of 40 million U.S. dollars. The Dota 2 tournament The International 2021 had a prize pool of $40,018,400.00. Even the NBA, a traditional sports league, has branched into esports with its NBA 2KLeague. As traditional sports and esports both increase in popularity, it is important to explore the differences or similarities present between communities of traditional sports and communities following esports.</p>

                            </figure>
                            <h3>Hate Speech in Esports</h3>
							<p>In particular, a concerning trend of esports is the prevalence of hate speech and toxicity. More internet-aware readers might remember the furor when YouTuber PewDiePie used the N-word on stream in 2017. Similarly, general sports enthusiasts might remember Miami Heat player Meyers Leonard being removed from his team after using an anti-Semitic slur on his own stream in 2021. These are just two examples of content creators taking part in this general environment of toxicity, and it is just the tip of the iceberg compared to player experiences in public team games. Activision banned over 350,000 Call of Duty in the first half of 2021 alone for hate speech.</p> 
                            <h3>Hate Speech in Traditional Sports</h3>
                            <p>This is not to say that traditional sports are free of hate speech/toxic behavior. In the 2019 NBA Finals, Kevin Durant was cheered by opposing fans after suffering an Achilles tear. This incident is not isolated, with other athletes also receiving continued harassment over in-game mistakes or personal decisions fans disliked. Our society puts an immense pressure on athletes to perform their absolute best at all times, and then berate them when they fail to live up to those expectations. Not unlike how people treat their teammates in anonymous game lobbies.</p>
                            <h3>Sports Viewers as a Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>The organization of sports and the rise of their prominence led to the development of more competitive scenes across all stages. As a sport grows in influence, the communities surrounding them generate a tremendous amount of data from discussions, opinions, or other insights of the given scene. It is crucial for marketers to better understand the target audience of a given sport, if they wish to enact intelligent advertising, as well as guide the creation of future products.</p>
                            <h3>Data Introduction</h3>
                            <p>Reddit is a good way to learn about society because it is, after all, the 'Front Page of the Internet'. It is a community-driven platform, which means that users can participate in discussions and share their thoughts and experiences on a wide variety of topics. This provides valuable insights into how people think and feel about a particular issue, and can help to shed light on the beliefs, values, and attitudes that are prevalent within Reddit society. Additionally, because Reddit is a large platform with many different communities, or "subreddits,‚Äù focused on specific topics, it is possible to find discussions and information on almost any subject, making it a rich source of information and knowledge on a wide range of topics.</p>
                            <p>For instance, the subreddit r/football is a community consisting of over 500,000 members to share any thoughts pertaining to football. In this way, we are able to gather and filter our data to include only discussions from various traditional sports or esports. For our analysis, we plan to take a small selection of subreddits that can be categorized as 'Traditional Sport' and 'Esport' in order to find differences in the words, tone, and language that they use. We will also try to find any key features that distinguish posts made by normal sports fans vs esports fans.</p>
                            <p>To go one step further, we recognized that Reddit, itself, is a microcosm of internet life. We worried that people who use Reddit are likely to be more Internet-savvy individuals already predisposed to engaging with esports more than someone who doesn't use Reddit. To test this, we compared some of our preliminary Reddit results to results from the same analysis done on Twitter posts.</p>
                            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                            <p>Given the inherent similarities between the two traditional sports and esports, the two cultures must share some traits in how they work. Our goal here is to explicitly investigate these two communities to better understand how much Internet toxicity is an inherent product of sport and how much comes from Internet-anonymity. Specifically, we expect that people involved in 'esports' conversations will be more likely to engage in harmful language and use negative framing around their posts. Whether or not this is actually the case remains to be seen. A list of preliminary business questions and their rationale are provided below. Although we did not tackle all of them, they were the foundation of our whole investigation.</p>

							<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
							<hr />
							<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
                            <p>Examining the missing values, the missing values for "submissions" are not that concerning. The majority of them fall within "selftext", which is the body of the post. Although this is concerning, something to note is that many Reddit posts are just a title. Since the title contains all the information, the poster leaves the body empty. However, by keeping these rows we are changing our investigation to consider one-off questions and thoughts. To get a deeper sense of Reddit communication, we will only consider 'meatier‚Äô posts that have body. The other columns with missings: "edited", "author", and "thumbnail" have very few missings. Thus, for data health, we will just remove them.</p>
                            <p>With respect to "comments", however, we need to be more discerning. The "body" missings are especially concerning: why would a comment have no text? Perhaps if it was deleted or moderated against? In this case, since we cannot be sure of the cause, and the amount of missings is small, we shall just drop the missing values for "comments.body". We will also want to remove NAs for "submission_id". This is the column we will use to latch the comments to their parent post. Without it, a major part of our analysis is impossible. Since there are few of these missings, we will just drop them as well. Similarly, "author" will be dropped. After this cleaning, there are 98,325,988 comments remaining for further analysis.</p>
                            <h3>Initial Pre-processing</h3>
                            <p>Another metric we will be looking into is the number of words in a given post/comment. This is to see if e-sport chat speech encourages people to use shorter messages relative to traditional sports. This will also give us a metric to compare the Reddit post content against Twitter posts.
                            <p>One final metric we will create here is the days_after_post variable for comments. This measures how many days after the original post a comment was posted. One of our hypotheses is that comments made very long after the original comment will be extreme in their sentiment. After all, people are likely to be more engaged by a post if they are engaging with it long after it is most relevant.</p>
                            <p>When evaluating the join process, we quickly checked for duplicate values. Fortunately, we were able to avoid having any duplicates in our joined commetns and posts. The other element we reconsider is the amount of missing values generated by the join. Here, we will actually avoid removing any missings! At this time, the missing values are not in columns we will be analyzing deeply. Thus, we can leave them in for now.</p>
                            <p>Finally, now that the data is put together, is to quickly summarize it. Our initial summary shows that esports has fewer overall comments relative to traditional sports. This makes sense because traditional sports are more entrenched with more fans. However, interestingly, esports comments have more word and comments tend to be posted on posts later on in the post lifecycle.</p>
                                
                            <figure>
                                <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/initial_summary.png" alt="" /></span>
                                <figcaption>Initial Summary of Reddit Data</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <h3>Let's make some graphs!</h3>
                            <p>First, we plotted the top 10 subreddits by the total number of posts. The bars were colored based on which sports type they fell under. Interestingly, we found a fairly even split in the top 10 between traditional sports and esports. League of Legends has the most posts by a significant margin, with the NBA and Soccer subreddits coming after.</p>
                            <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/top_ten_subreddits2.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>After that, the length of comments was examined. Ultimately, we found an inverse relationship! The traditional sports subreddits have longer bodies but shorter titles, while the reverse is true for esports.</p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image eighty"><img src="images/mean_length_submission2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image eighty"><img src="images/mean_length_comment_text2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>Our team was also interested in examining the cyclicality of Reddit activity. One easy way was to see how activity changes by the day of the week. This should be an easy way to point out short-term trends that jump out.</p>
                            <p>Unsurprisingly, we continue to find that League of Legends is the most dominant esport on Reddit. It has by far the mosts posts for any given day. The actual post activity for each of the esports doesn‚Äôt seem to rely on day much. This is not the case for traditional sports. The day definitely plays a role in how many posts were made. For example, the most NFL posts were made on Monday, probably in the aftermath of NFL Sunday. Similarly, the UFC subreddit seems the most posts on Sundays, probably in reaction to fights.</p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/esports_posts_by_day2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/sports_posts_by_day2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>In terms of comments, League is the most popular, though it has a noticeable midweek dive. This is somewhat similar for the other esports that each have days of high and low activity. For sports comments, NFL Sunday reigns supreme! After a long day of watching football, it does appear that many Redditors post comments on the NFL subreddit, more than for any sport on any other day! Outside of the NFL though, day does not seem to change comment activity much for each sport.</p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/esports_comment_avg_day2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/sports_comment_by_day2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>Next is to see how many comments are posted on each day out from the original post. Here, we actually have to take the logarithm of the total number of comments for each day. This is because, the highest comment count frequencies come right as the post comes out. Within the first few days, the total comments plumments by orders of magnitude. To reflect this while scaling the data, a log transformation was used.</p>
                            <p>Using the below plot, you can see that the first 10 or so days of a post sees significantly more comment traffic than anything after. Most posts also start seeing noticeably less comments after ~175 days. After that, there is some fluctuation, with the longest lived posts seeming to tail off at around 1.5 years.</p>
                            <span class="image eighty"><img src="images/total_comments_n_days2.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>Finally, to launch a small foray into sentiment analysis, we will plot the controversiality of posts. Reddit actually calculates this natively as a ratio of Upvotes to Downvotes. The closer to 1, the more ‚Äòcontroversial‚Äô a post is. The further away from 1, the less controversial it is. We will collect the average controversiality of various subreddits.</p>
                            <p>Using the chart below, we can see taht soccer and Premier League subreddits are, on average, the most controversial. In fact, the 8 of the 9 most controversial subreddits are all traditional sports, with only two esports subreddits cracking the top ten (r/leagueoflegends and r/DotA2). Another interesting finding is that, while r/nba has the third-highest controversy rating, r/basketball has the lowest!</p>
                            <p>In the future, we can use the controversy scores by comparing them to our own sentiment analysis and hate speech analysis during the NLP portion of this project.</p>
                            <span class="image eighty"><img src="images/mean_controversy_rating2.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />

							<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>

							<h3>Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Data</h3>
                            <p><b>General Sentiment by Community</b></p>
                            <p>The natural first instinct when it comes to text data, especially in potentially headed topics like competitive sports and esports. We‚Äôre interested in what this discourse looks like - is it overly positive, critical, or neutral. Positive and negative posts are obvious - "Lebron James scores amazing game winner over the Pacers‚Äù is positive while "10 reasons why DotA sucks‚Äù is negative. Neutral posts, we discovered, primarily consist of news, e.g. "FINAL SCORE: Mariners 3, Guardians 1."</p>
                            <p>That breakdown by sport type is below:</p>
                            <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/sentiment_sport_type2.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>Far and away the biggest difference between the two communities comes from the negative post submissions. While only 39.1% of post submissions in traditional sports are negative, 61.4% of posts are negative in the esports communities. While not as clear from the above chart, there‚Äôs a similar difference when it comes to the percentage of positive posts. While only 34.8% of posts are positive in the esport communities, 55.6% of posts in traditional sporting communities are positive.</p>
							<p><b>Submission Text Length</b></p>
                            <p>An additional factor to consider is how long a submission is within the context of sentiment analysis. Here, we may find that both positive and negative posts provide either long, detailed compliments or critiques, or very short quips that may not have much evidential backing.</p>
                            <p>The breakdown by sentiment and sport type is below:</p>
                            <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/submission_type_sentiment2.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>There doesn't appear to be that much new information from this perspective that we couldn‚Äôt already glean from the prior analysis on submission text length. It is mildly interesting to see that there is a higher average text length for positive posts than negative and neutral posts in the esports communities. We also can see that, for traditional sports, a post with either a positive or negative sentiment is typically longer than a neutral post. This is understandable, given that neutral posts tend to be headline/news information, while positive/negative posts require a bit more explanation.</p>
                            <p><b>Wordclouds</b></p>
                            <p>Of course, sentiment analysis and word count can only get us so far ‚Äì we also need to take a look at the posts themselves! The clearest way to identify the most common words and topics is to do a simple wordcloud and compare the two. But first, it is important to establish a baseline - what do all of these conversations have in common? To do this, let's look at the wordcloud that combines all communities:</p>
                            <span class="image forty"><img src="images/total_wordcloud.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>A lot of these make intrinsic sense - in both sports and esports there are games that people, called players, play on teams. A lot of the larger words apply to both communities, so it will be important to our analysis to look at where the words differ.</p>

                            <p>The clearest difference is the play vs. player divide between esports and traditional sports respectively. Presumably this is due to people colloquially calling traditional athletes "players‚Äù while gamers "play‚Äù esports.</p>
                            <p><b>Dummy Variables</b></p>
                            <p>We decided to create several dummy variables that took this into account. Surprisingly, our assumption that 'cheating' and 'competition' as key words were not as prolific as we thought. These results are below:</p>
                            <p>Just the word 'cheating' was rare within the tweets and subreddits that we examined. Below shows that, despite our wide range and collection of tweets and subreddits, we did not see the accusations of cheating that we thought would be prevalent.</p>
                            <span class="image twenty"><img src="images/cheating_tweets.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>The same goes for the word 'Scompetition':</p>
                            <span class="image twenty"><img src="images/competition_tweets.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>Despite all of these being competitions, they aren‚Äôt referred to as such. Instead, as the word cloud from above shows us, its far more likely that more colloquial terms are used (e.g. "game‚Äù or "tournament‚Äù) as opposed to just 'competition.'' Both this discovery and the above discovery highlight how difficult it is to extract dummy variables from internet forums, as not only are there limited opportunities for words to be said, but any researcher must have intricate knowledge about how communities speak before attempting to identify certain dummy variables for further investigation.</p>
                            <p><b>TF-IDF</b></p>
                            <p>To solve the above problem, we looked into TF-IDF analysis to come to a conclusion about what is talked about. Below are our results.</p>

                            <p>Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency is a measure of word importance in a corpus. Through this metric, we can determine that the words above are crucial words in the vocabulary utilized in regards to various traditional sports and esports. These words are crucial when it comes to feature building.</p>
                            <h3>Sentiment Analysis of Tweets</h3>
                            <p>With Reddit as a base, we wanted to take a look at how it compares to another social media‚Äôs conversations, Twitter. We pulled 500 tweets on each topic, ranging from League of Legends to Basketball, and ran a similar sentiment analysis examination as the above. While we weren‚Äôt as interested in word counts of posts (due to the inherent limit on Twitter), we were looking at how the two compared in a broader sense - are Twitter and Reddit share the same sentiments on these topics?</p>
                            <p>Below are the results for traditional sports and esports topics:</p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image eighty"><img src="images/tradsport_tweet_sentiment_waffle.png" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <span class="image eighty"><img src="images/esport_tweet_sentiment_waffle.png" alt="" /></span>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>There are a few hypothesis as to why Twitter is so positive. Twitter is a positive place for sports and esports fans because it allows them to connect with other fans and share their thoughts and opinions about the latest games and events. With Twitter, fans can follow their favorite teams and players and get instant updates on game scores, highlights, and other important news. They can also join in on real-time conversations about the games and events, sharing their own thoughts and reactions as they happen. Additionally, Twitter is a great place for fans to find and share interesting articles, videos, and other content related to sports and esports. All of these factors make Twitter a positive and engaging platform for sports and esports fans.</p>
                            <p>By far, the largest takeaway is that Twitter is, generally, much more positive than Reddit (potentially for the reasons above). While both definitely have negative (and neutral) posts at times, Twitter is much, much more positive in both types of sports.</p>

							<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                            <hr />
                            <p>In addition to natural language processing analysis conducted on the previous page, it is clear that this data lends itself well to machine learning analysis. Machine learning in this context would allow Reddit consumers and analysts to automatically learn and improve from data, without the need for explicit programming (which only some people have, especially at the C-Suite level). This can be particularly useful in situations where it is difficult or impossible to develop a traditional algorithm that accurately models a complex system such as Reddit, where there are nearly one million posts a day across 2.8 million subreddits. We asked ourselves what Reddit users and what executives at Reddit would want to know about their website.</p>
                            <h3>Classifying Sport Type of Post</h3>
                            <p>There are a few reasons why it would be important for a Reddit executive or analyst to decipher what type of subreddit an individual post comes from. For example, a person might want to build a recommendation system that suggests subreddits to users based on their interests or activity on the site. In order to do this effectively, the model would need to be able to accurately differentiate between the various subreddits on Reddit in order to provide relevant recommendations. Additionally, a person might build a model to differentiate between subreddits in order to study the characteristics and features of each subreddit, or to identify trends or patterns within specific subreddits. After testing various models, we created a machine learning model that could accurately predict which type of subreddit a post was in nearly 80% of the time. The confusion matrix, which describes the performance of our classification model, is shown below:</p>
                            <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/predicted_sport_type.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>The initial results are quite promising! Our accuracy is 80%, and we are not seeing an undue bias in the classifier. To get a sense of what the model is actually using, we plotted the feature importances. Interestingly, the lions share of the predictive power was coming from the number of comments and the score for the posts! This indicates that overall post engagement differs between esport and traditional sport subreddits.</p>
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/rf_feature_importances.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>As a bit of an experiment, we retrained our model using only the number of comments on a post and the post‚Äôs scores as the sole inputs. Theoretically, while these two are the most impactful predictors above, the model should suffer since there are significantly fewer predictors to use in the model. Surely at least a few of those features must help a little bit!</p>
                            <p>To our surprise, that‚Äôs not what happens. Although the change is minimal, the simpler, more parsimonious model actually has a better performance by a few tenths of a percent. That confusion matrix is below:</p>
                            <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/pars_confusion_matrix.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>This indicates that these two features alone are enough to build a decent model for identifying the subreddit type. This is wonderful news, as it is generally better to have fewer inputs into a classification model because it can help to reduce the complexity of the model and make it more interpretable. A model with fewer inputs is also less likely to overfit the data, which can lead to better generalization performance on unseen data. Additionally, having fewer inputs can also make the model more efficient and easier to train, which can save time and resources. Of course, there is a trade-off, as having too few inputs can also limit the model‚Äôs ability to accurately capture the nuances of the data and make accurate predictions. This the reason why we have presented both models ‚Äì so that decision makers can make the decision between the two models and not feel forced to pick either one.</p>
                            <h3>Predicting the Score of a Post</h3>
                            <p>Naturally, score is one of the most important variables within our data ‚Äì and one of the most interesting. If you are a Reddit user, you might want to know how popular a post is likely to be before you submit it, so that you can decide whether it is worth the effort to write it. Additionally, you might want to understand post scores as a way of understanding how Reddit‚Äôs voting system works, and as a result you would find out waht factors are most important in determining the popularity of a post. You could then inject those attributes into your own posts to become more popular online. While individual users would definitely find this useful, one other actor might as well: marketing companies. If you are a business that is using Reddit for marketing purposes, you might be interested in predicting post scores as a way of identifying which posts are likely to be the most effective in reaching your target audience.</p>
                            <p>With the importance of predicting score in mind, we decided to create both regression and classification models to learn as much as we could about what makes a post do well on Reddit. Notably, we made the active decision to look at the attributes of the post (e.g. number of comments, text length, sentiment) for the regression model, and looked solely at the text and its length for the classification model. This decision is explained more below.</p>
                            <h3>Using a Regression Model</h3>
                            <p>The natural first step when looking at a continuous outcome is to build a regression model. We identified seven variables that we believed would have some impact on the model, which are as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The number of comments on the post</li>
                                <li>The number of crossposts (i.e. when an additional user takes a single post from one community and shares it within another community)</li>
                                <li>If the post had been edited after submission</li>
                                <li>If the post had been hidden after submission</li>
                                <li>If the post had an age restriction of 18+</li>
                                <li>The length of the post</li>
                                <li>The sentiment of the post, as determined in the NLP section of this investigation</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>We created two models: one that used a basic random forest regression, the other that used a random forest algorithm that helped us optimal hyperparameters for the model. Either can be used, but we found that the hyperparameter-turned model, even if a bit more computationally expensive, increased our accuracy enough to warrant the extra cost. Through this model, we are able to ascertain what the most important factors for a high score are, as shown below:</p>
                            <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/feat_rf.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>We can see from above that, by far, the most important feature of a post when it comes to score is the number of comments below the post. This makes sense, as we would expect a high number of comments for a high-scoring post. The same goes for the number of crossposts, the second most important feature. It‚Äôs only at the third most important feature, text length, that we see something within the control of the poster. We also see that there‚Äôs a little bit of influence that the sentiment of the post or its edited status, but they both pale in comparison to the number of comments and the number of crossposts features.</p>
                            <h3>Exploring Differences between Esports and Traditional Sports Subreddits</h3>
                            <p>Out of curiosity (and the want to use a pipeline), we also explored if the features would have different levels of importance for each type of sport.</p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <figure><span class="image fit"><img src="images/feat_trad.png" alt="" /></span>
                                        <figcaption>traditional sports</figcaption>
                                    </figure>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                    <figure><span class="image eighty"><img src="images/feat_esports.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <figcaption>esports</figcaption>
                                    </figure>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <p>We can see that, while the features have the same rank of importance, the number of comments is far more indicative of a high score in the traditional sports communities than in esports communities. This appears to come at the expense of the relative importance of the number of crossposts and the text lengths of posts in the traditional spo0rts communities.</p>
                            <h3>Using a Classification Model</h3>
                            <p>On a simpler level, people are unlikely to care how well a particular post does, and more that it does well generally. That is, is it gaining a bit of traction or is it stalling out? With this in mind, we also build a classification model to determine if a post would be successful or not. We defined successful as being better than the median post, meaning that a score of four or higher would be defined as a success, while anything lower than four would be deemed a failure, noting that scores can also be negative or zero.</p>
                            <p>Our main model looked at the text of the post itself, as we determined that a combination of what is said and the length of the post are the only factors that can reasonably be controlled by an individual user. An individual user cannot reasonably add a significant number of comments or crossposts, making those factors irrelevant in this context. While it‚Äôs possible for a single user to create a plethora of additional accounts for this purpose, we don‚Äôt expect that this happens often enough, if at all, to impact the model.</p>
                            <p>When we take a look at the text itself combined with the length of the text, we are able to build a model that can successfully predict the success of a post with an accuracy of .75, as shown below:</p>
                            <span class="image sixty"><img src="images/classifier_conf_matrix.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <br />
                            <p>This is fairly reliable and does show, ultimately, that what person says within the post does have a rather significant impact on how popular it gets. This also tells us that simple links, which are common across the entirety of the platform, is not enough to be successful. Instead, it is adding some sort of summary or even some additional analysis that helps. On a broader scale, this is substantial evidence showing how what you say, and not just who says it, matters.</p>
